# SIGN-LANGUAGE-DETECTION-USING-ACTION-RECOGNITION
The "Sign Language Detection Using Action Recognition" project leverages MediaPipe and LSTM-based neural networks to develop a real-time sign language interpretation system. By capturing keypoint detection and temporal dynamics of gestures, it promotes seamless communication and inclusivity for the hearing-impaired community.
